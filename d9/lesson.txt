Reduce HTML markups
    - place multiple classes in a single div if no conflicts.
    - have meaningful class name to easily know its effect.

Adding Image
    - include alt text
    - wrap inside a div to avoid getting distorted from parent properties.

align-self: property; // allows default alignment to be overriden for individual flex items
justify-content: property; // defines alignment along the main axis. Distributes leftover space
    - dictates the layout of flex items in a container.

Ensure Responsive Image
    - add max-width: 100%; to .img selector
    - avoids overflow or side-scrolling in small screen sizes
