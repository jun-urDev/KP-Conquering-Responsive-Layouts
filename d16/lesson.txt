Breakpoints
    - is the “point” at which a website's content and design will adapt in a certain way in order to provide the best possible user experience.

When to use breakpoints?
    - play with dev tools 'responsive mode' and see when your layout breaks. (1-3 breakpoints are enough)

Common breakpoints:
    600px - phones
    900px - tablets
    1200px - desktops
    1800px - big monitors
