Viewport Units
-can also be used for font sizes but can pose problems of typography being too big/small in certain screen sizes.

1) Viewport Height (vh) - This unit is based on the height of the viewport. A value of 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height.
2) Viewport Width (vw) - This unit is based on the width of the viewport. A value of 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width.
3) Viewport Minimum (vmin) - This unit is based on the smaller dimension of the viewport. If the viewport height is smaller than the width, the value of 1vmin will be equal to 1% of the viewport height. Similarly, if the viewport width is smaller than the height, the value of 1vmin will be equal to 1% of the viewport width.
4) Viewport Maximum (vmax) - This unit is based on the larger dimension of the viewport. If the viewport height is larger than the width, the value of 1vmax will be equal to 1% of viewport height. Similarly, if the viewport width is larger than the height, the value of 1vmax will be equal to 1% of hte viewport width.

Problem with viewport units
-On small screen sizes, content may spill to other sections essentially blocking other contents.
