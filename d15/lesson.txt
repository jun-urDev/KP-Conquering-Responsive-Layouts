Media Queries
    - modify your site or app depending on a device's general type (such as print vs. screen) or specific characteristics and parameters (such as screen resolution or browser viewport width).

        @media media type(media features) {     // media type can be omitted but can also use logical operator if using more than one feature
            // code
        }

        Logical Operators:
        and
            - used for combining multiple media features together into a single media query, requiring each chained feature to return true for the query to be true. It is also used for joining media features with media types.
        not
            - used to negate a media query, returning true if the query would otherwise return false. If present in a comma-separated list of queries, it will only negate the specific query to which it is applied. If you use the not operator, you must also specify a media type.
        only
            - used to apply a style only if an entire query matches, and is useful for preventing older browsers from applying selected styles. When not using only, older browsers would interpret the query screen and (max-width: 500px) as screen, ignoring the remainder of the query, and applying its styles on all screens. If you use the only operator, you must also specify a media type.
        (,) comma
            - used to combine multiple media queries into a single rule. Each query in a comma-separated list is treated separately from the others. Thus, if any of the queries in a list is true, the entire media statement returns true. In other words, lists behave like a logical or operator.

        - Media features describe the specific characteristics of a given user agent, output device, or environment. For instance, you can apply specific styles to widescreen monitors, computers that use mice, or to devices that are being used in low-light conditions.
        - often used media feature is width:
            (min-width: 600px) - screen size >= 600px / 600px or bigger
            (max-width: 600px) - screen size <= 600px / 600px or smaller
        - media queries should be always be in ascending or descending order depending on the approach used. (mobile or desktop)
        - often placed at the bottom of css
