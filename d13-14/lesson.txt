Useful CSS Functions:
    min();
        - lets you set the smallest (most negative) value from a list of comma-separated expressions as the value of a CSS property value.
        - The min() function can be used anywhere a <length>, <frequency>, <angle>, <time>, <percentage>, <number>, or <integer> is allowed.

    max();
        - lets you set the largest (most positive) value from a list of comma-separated expressions as the value of a CSS property value.
        - The max() function can be used anywhere a <length>, <frequency>, <angle>, <time>, <percentage>, <number>, or <integer> is allowed.

    clamp(); 
        - clamps a value between an upper and lower bound. clamp() enables selecting a middle value within a range of values between a defined minimum and maximum.
        - It takes three parameters: a minimum value, a preferred value, and a maximum allowed value. The clamp() function can be used anywhere a <length>, <frequency>, <angle>, <time>, <percentage>, <number>, or <integer> is allowed.
        - clamp(MIN, VAL, MAX) is resolved as max()(MIN, min()(VAL, MAX))

    calc();
        - lets you perform calculations when specifying CSS property values.
        - It can be used anywhere a <length>, <frequency>, <angle>, <time>, <percentage>, <number>, or <integer> is allowed.

    other solution:
        font-size: calc(1vw + .rem); // scales font size depending on viewport
