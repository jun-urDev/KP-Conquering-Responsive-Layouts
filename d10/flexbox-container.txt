Flexbox Container
    flex-direction: property;
        dictates direction of flex items.
            row - default, flex items go side-by-side along X-axis (left - right)
            row-reverse - flex items go side-by-side along X-axis (right - left)
            column - flex items create a stack along Y-axis (top - bottom)

    flex-wrap: property;
        dictates how flex items will handle overflow.
            nowrap - default, flex items continue to go side-by-side with no regards to overflow
            wrap - flex items will go to next line if theres overflow

    flex-flow: property; // shorthand for combined flex-direction and flex-wrap and their properties.

    justify-content: property; (X-axis by default but Y-axis if flex-direction is column)
        It defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.
            flex-start (default): items are packed toward the start line
            flex-end: items are packed toward to end line
            center - center: items are centered along the line
            space-between - items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line
            space-around - items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them
            space-evenly - items are distributed so that the spacing between any two adjacent alignment subjects, before the first alignment subject, and after the last alignment subject is the same

    align-items: property; (Y-axis by default but X-axis if flex-direction is column)
        defines the default behavior for how items are laid out along the cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis).
            stretch (default) - stretch to fill the container (still respect min-width/max-width)
            flex-start - cross-start margin edge of the items is placed on the cross-start line
            flex-end - cross-end margin edge of the items is placed on the cross-end line
            center - items are centered in the cross-axis
            baseline - items are aligned such as their baselines align

    align-content: property; 
        It helps to align a flex containerâ€™s lines within it when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis.
            stretch (default) - lines stretch to take up the remaining space 
            flex-start - lines packed to the start of the container
            flex-end - lines packed to the end of the container
            center - lines packed to the center of the container
            space-between - lines evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the container while the last one is at the end
            space-around - lines evenly distributed with equal space between them
