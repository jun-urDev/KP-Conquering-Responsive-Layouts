Meta Viewport Tag
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        - ensures website to respond the way it suppose to be.
    width
        - controls the size of the viewport. It can be set to a specific number of pixels like width=600 or to the special value device-width, which is the width of the screen in CSS pixels at a scale of 100%. (There are corresponding height and device-height values, which may be useful for pages with elements that change size or position based on the viewport height.)
    initial-scale
        - controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded. The maximum-scale, minimum-scale, and user-scalable properties control how users are allowed to zoom the page in or out.
